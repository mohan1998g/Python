1. Using Python
a. Using reduce() Function in Python
The reduce() function applies a function cumulatively to the items of a sequence, from left to right, to reduce the sequence to a single value.

python
Copy code
from functools import reduce

# Array of 10 numbers
numbers = [12, 45, 23, 67, 34, 89, 15, 78, 91, 56]

# Use reduce to find the highest number
max_number = reduce(lambda x, y: x if x > y else y, numbers)

print("Highest number using reduce:", max_number)
Output:

python
Copy code
Highest number using reduce: 91
b. Using a Loop in Python
You can use a simple loop to iterate through the list and track the highest number.


# Array of 10 numbers
numbers = [12, 45, 23, 67, 34, 89, 15, 78, 91, 56]

# Initialize max_number with the first element
max_number = numbers[0]

# Loop through the list to find the highest number
for number in numbers:
    if number > max_number:
        max_number = number

print("Highest number using loop:", max_number)
Output:

python
Copy code
Highest number using loop: 91
