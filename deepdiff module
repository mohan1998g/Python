Overview of DeepDiff
DeepDiff is a powerful Python library used for finding differences between complex Python objects. These objects can include dictionaries, lists, sets, tuples, strings, and more. DeepDiff is particularly useful for comparing nested structures like JSON objects, dictionaries, or other complex data structures. It can handle various types of changes, including value changes, type changes, item additions, removals, and more.

Installation
To install DeepDiff, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install deepdiff
Key Features
Compare complex nested structures like dictionaries, lists, and sets.
Track changes such as additions, removals, updates, and type changes.
Customizable: Fine-tune what changes you want to track (e.g., ignore specific fields).
Detailed differences: Shows the exact location of differences in nested structures.
Handle floats: Allows comparison of float values with precision control.
Core Functionalities
DeepDiff: The main function for deep comparison.
Delta: Applies the difference from DeepDiff to another object.
DeepHash: A utility for hashing complex objects.
DeepSearch: Allows searching through complex data structures for a specific value or type.
DeepCopy: For deep copying complex structures.
Basic Usage
Here are some basic examples of how to use DeepDiff:

1. Basic Dictionary Comparison
python
Copy code
from deepdiff import DeepDiff

dict1 = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
dict2 = {'name': 'John', 'age': 31}

diff = DeepDiff(dict1, dict2)
print(diff)
Output:

python
Copy code
{'values_changed': {"root['age']": {'new_value': 31, 'old_value': 30}}}
2. Comparing Lists
python
Copy code
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 4]

diff = DeepDiff(list1, list2)
print(diff)
Output:

python
Copy code
{'values_changed': {"root[2]": {'new_value': 4, 'old_value': 3}}}
3. Nested Data Structures (e.g., JSON)
python
Copy code
nested_dict1 = {'user': {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'hobbies': ['reading', 'running']}}
nested_dict2 = {'user': {'name': 'John', 'age': 31, 'hobbies': ['reading', 'cycling']}}

diff = DeepDiff(nested_dict1, nested_dict2)
print(diff)
Output:

python
Copy code
{
    'values_changed': {"root['user']['age']": {'new_value': 31, 'old_value': 30}},
    'iterable_item_removed': {"root['user']['hobbies'][1]": 'running'},
    'iterable_item_added': {"root['user']['hobbies'][1]": 'cycling'}
}
4. Handling Set Differences
python
Copy code
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {1, 2, 4}

diff = DeepDiff(set1, set2)
print(diff)
Output:

python
Copy code
{
    'set_item_removed': {3},
    'set_item_added': {4}
}
Advanced Features
1. Ignore Specific Fields
You can ignore specific fields or paths during comparison.

python
Copy code
dict1 = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
dict2 = {'name': 'John', 'age': 31}

diff = DeepDiff(dict1, dict2, exclude_paths="root['age']")
print(diff)
Output:

python
Copy code
{}
2. Tolerances for Floats
You can set a tolerance for comparing floating-point numbers:

python
Copy code
float1 = {'value': 1.0001}
float2 = {'value': 1.0002}

diff = DeepDiff(float1, float2, significant_digits=3)
print(diff)
Output:

python
Copy code
{}
3. Comparing Types
DeepDiff can also compare the types of values:

python
Copy code
dict1 = {'value': 1}
dict2 = {'value': '1'}

diff = DeepDiff(dict1, dict2)
print(diff)
Output:

python
Copy code
{'type_changes': {"root['value']": {'old_type': <class 'int'>, 'new_type': <class 'str'>, 'old_value': 1, 'new_value': '1'}}}
4. Applying Deltas
The Delta class allows you to apply the differences found by DeepDiff to another object:

python
Copy code
from deepdiff import DeepDiff, Delta

obj1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
obj2 = {"a": 1, "b": 3}
diff = DeepDiff(obj1, obj2)

delta = Delta(diff)
new_obj = delta.apply(obj1)
print(new_obj)  # {'a': 1, 'b': 3}
5. Hashing Complex Objects
DeepHash helps you create hash values of complex nested structures:

python
Copy code
from deepdiff import DeepHash

obj = {'name': 'John', 'hobbies': ['reading', 'running']}
hashed_obj = DeepHash(obj)
print(hashed_obj)
Output:

python
Copy code
{140000000: 'e9f43a1e486b3b2e622f1459e44e6bc7'}
6. Searching Through Data
You can search for a specific value within complex data structures:

python
Copy code
from deepdiff import DeepSearch

data = {"person": {"name": "John", "age": 30}}
search = DeepSearch(data, "John")
print(search)
Output:

python
Copy code
{'matched_values': {"root['person']['name']": 'John'}}
Configurable Parameters
DeepDiff provides a wide range of options to fine-tune its behavior:

exclude_paths: Ignore specific paths in the object comparison.
exclude_types: Ignore changes to certain types of objects.
significant_digits: Control the precision for comparing floats.
ignore_order: Ignore the order of elements in lists, tuples, or sets.
ignore_string_case: Ignore case differences in strings.
report_repetition: Identify repeated items in sequences.
ignore_type_in_groups: Ignore types of elements within specific data groups.
view: Controls how the results are displayed (text, tree, delta).
Output Structure
DeepDiff outputs results in a structured format where the keys represent the type of change, and the values show the location and details of the change. The common change types include:

values_changed: Indicates that a value was changed.
type_changes: Indicates that the type of a value changed.
iterable_item_added: Indicates an item was added to an iterable.
iterable_item_removed: Indicates an item was removed from an iterable.
set_item_added: Indicates an item was added to a set.
set_item_removed: Indicates an item was removed from a set.
dictionary_item_added: Indicates a key-value pair was added to a dictionary.
dictionary_item_removed: Indicates a key-value pair was removed from a dictionary.
Summary
DeepDiff is a flexible and powerful library for deep comparisons of Python objects, handling complex and nested structures.
It provides a wide variety of customization options to control how differences are detected, including ignoring certain paths, setting precision for floats, and handling order in sequences.
DeepDiff is easy to use for common Python data structures such as dictionaries, lists, and sets, and outputs detailed information on the differences between objects.
